  ## Acknowledgements
  
  Chad David Cover, for providing insight on fixing the API call in axios and combining the objects returned from the API call and Inquirer questions
  
  Kenneth de Guzman, for collaborating on the api call to Github for sorting through events to find the Push Events that provide user email and avatar.
  
  ***
  
  ## Issues
  
  Due to the nature of the API call, the requested user needs to have commits made within the past 30 events for the information to show.
